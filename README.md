# Cache-Memory-Simulation
The code simulates a memory hierarchy system involving Main Memory, L1 cache(Direct mapping), L2 cache(K way Set Associative), and a Victim cache(Fully Associative), implementing load and store operations while managing cache hits, misses, and replacements. It updates the caches based on user inputs, ensuring efficient data retrieval.
