# Cache-Memory-Simulation
-[] This program simulates a multi-level cache system with L1, L2, and a victim cache to optimize memory access. 
-[] It handles cache hits and misses by first checking the L1 cache, then the victim cache, and finally the L2 cache if necessary. 
-[] The program supports both load and store operations, updating cache lines and handling replacements when cache blocks are full. It ensures that data is efficiently transferred between caches and main memory based on user input, while also maintaining correct memory hierarchy and consistency across all cache levels.
